 * and tile the smaller image in a 2 x 2 grid over the original dimensions
 * of the image, and return the pixel at the appropriate coordinate from
 * the tiled image, brightened on each R/G/B channel by the required amount.
 * 
 * The value of each pixel in the scaled image will be a bilinear interpolation
 * of a 2x2 pixel region from the original image, with each of the R/G/B/A channels
 * processed individually. Interpolate over the x-axis before the y-axis.
 * Truncate any fractional values on the R/G/B channels. Brighten each color channel
 * as the final step.
 * 
 * @pre referenceimg width and height are both even
